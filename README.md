**NANNY STATE** makes it simple to build dynamic, state-based web apps in vanilla JS.

- **SIMPLE** - build interactive user-interfaces with just a few lines of code.
- **FAST** - automatic page renders that are blazingly fast.
- **MINIMAL** - only 3kb minified and zipped.

## The State Is Everything

**NANNY STATE** stores everything about the app in a single state object and automatically re-renders the view when the state changes. This means that your code is more organized and easier to maintain without the bloat of other libraries. And everything is written in vanilla JS and HTML, which means you don't have to learn any new syntax!

It's easy to get started - just follow the [examples](#examples) below and you'll see some impressive results in just a few lines of code.

## What Is NANNY STATE?

NANNY STATE uses a one-way data flow model comprised of 3 interdependent parts:

* **State** - an object or value that stores all the app data
* **View** -  a function that returns a string of HTML based on the current state
* **Update** - a function that is the only way to change the state and re-render the view

<div align="center">
  
![Nanny State data flow diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16646/164986422-203df76e-05c8-49f7-bc3b-3a0a108aca03.png)

</div>

In NANNY STATE, the state is everything. It is the single source of truth in the application and it can only be changed using the `Update` function, ensuring that any changes are deterministic with predictable outcomes. The view is an HTML representation of the data stored in the state. When a user interacts with the page, the `Update` function changes the state and the view is automatically re-rendered to reflect these changes.

## Background

NANNY STATE was inspired by [Hyperapp](https://hyperapp.dev) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org) and uses the [Âµhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml) library for rendering. It is open source software; please feel free to help out or contribute.

The name is inspired by the [British phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanny_state) for an overly protective, centralised government. In a similar way, NANNY STATE protects all the app data by storing it centrally.

## Installation

### Using NPM CLI

Install [nanny-state](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanny-state) from NPM.

```bash
npm install nanny-state
```

Then import like this:

```javascript
import { Nanny, html } from "nanny-state"
```

### ES Modules

If you use ES Modules, you don't need NPM. You can import from a CDN URL in your browser or on CodePen.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { Nanny,html } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/nanny-state'
</script>
```

## Quick Start Guide

Building a NANNY STATE app is simple and straightforward. It always follows these steps:

1. Import the `Nanny` and `html` functions:
   ```javascript
   import { Nanny, html } from 'nanny-state'
   ````

2. Create the `View` template - a pure function that accepts the state as its only parameter and outputs a string of HTML:
   ```javascript
   const View = state =>
      html`<h1>Hello ${state.name}
           <button onclick=${state._changeName}>Click Me</button>`
   ```
   
3. Create an event handler to call the `Update` function and update the state:
  ```javascript
  const _changeName = event => Update({ name: "Nanny State" })
  ```
  
4. Create the initial `State` object (everything goes in the State, props, the View and event handlers):
   ````javascript
   const State = { 
      name: "World",
      _changeName,
      View
     }
   ```

5. Assign the `Update` function to the return value of `Nanny(State)`:
  ```javascript
  const Update = Nanny(State)
  ```

<div id="examples">
  
## Usage examples

The easiest way to learn how NANNY STATE works is to try coding some examples. All the examples below can be coded on [CodePen](https://codepen.io) by simply entering the code in the 'JS' section. 

Alternatively you could set up a basic HTML file and place all the code inside the `<script>` tags. You can see [example files here](https://github.com/daz4126/Nanny-State/tree/main/examples/counter).

And if you want it to look pretty, just copy the CSS code from the examples on CodePen!

### Hello World Example

<div align="center">

![Hello World screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16646/164986455-102d1310-c092-45a5-a8af-c939252da436.png)

</div>

This example will show how the 3 elements of Nanny State, State, View and the Update function, work.

Start by importing the relevant functions:

```javascript
import { Nanny, html } from 'nanny-state'
```

Next we'll create the view. This is a function that accepts the state as an argument and returns a string of HTML that depends on the value of the state's properties. 

```javascript
const View = state => html`<h1>Hello World</h1>`
```

Views in NANNY STATE use the `html` template function that is part of Âµhtml. This is a tag function that accepts a template literal as an argument. The template literal contains the HTML code that we want to display in our app. 

These values are then bound to the view and will automatically update to reflect any changes in the state. In this example we are inserting the value of the state object's 'name' property into the `<h1>` element.

In NANNY STATE, everything is stored as a property of the state, even the app settings such as the view! This means that we have to add the `View` code to the `State` object. Since we named the variable `View`, we can just use object-shortand notation to add this to the `State` object, like so:

```javascript
const State = { 
  View 
}
```

Last of all, we need to call the `Nanny` function with `State` provided as an argument:

```javascript
Nanny(State)
```

This passes the `State` object into the `Nanny` function, which renders the view based on the initial state.

You can this code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/daz4126/pen/gOoBryB).

<div align="center">
  
![Hello World!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16646/168495571-19bd4fa0-0854-4560-9f77-68541a08c602.png)

</div>

This is just a static piece of HTML though. The view in Nanny State can display dynamic expressions using `${expression}` placeholders to insert properties from the state.

Let's add a property called 'name', with a value of the string "World", to the state:
  
  ```javascript
  State = {
    name: "World",
    View
  }
  ```
  
Now let's update the `View` to use this property:
  
```javascript
const View = state => html`<h1>Hello ${state.name}</h1>`
```
Even though, outwardly, nothing seems to have changed, we are now using properties of the `State` in the `View`.

You can this code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/daz4126/pen/jOYeqoN).

Our next job is to make the view dynamic. First of all we'll add a button to the view:
  
```javascript
const View = state => 
  html`<h1>Hello ${state.name}</h1>
       <button onclick=${state._changeName}>Hello</button>`
```

The button element has an inline event listener. When the button is clicked the event handler `_changeName` will be called (by convention, event handlers start with an `_` to differentiate them from other properties in the State). We want this function to update the state object so the 'name' property changes to 'Nanny State'. This is exactly what the `Update` function is for.
  
The `Update` function is returned when the `Nanny` function is called. Calling the `Nanny` function does 2 things:

1. Renders the initial view based on the initial value of the `State` variable that is passed to it.
2. Returns the `Update` function - this is the only way that the state can be updated in the app.
  
To create the `Update` function, change the last line of code so it assigns the variable `Update` to the return value of `Nanny(State)`:
  
```javascript
const Update = Nanny(State)
```
  
*Note that it is only called `Update` by convention and can actually be called any legal variable name.*

Now we can use the `Update` function to update the state when the button is clicked. This is really easy to do - simply pass an object representing the new state as an argument to the `Update` function.
  
To do this we need to add the `_changeName` event handler to the State:
  
```javascript
 const State = {
  name: "World",
  _changeName: event => Update({name: "Nanny State"}),
  View
} 
```

Because `_changeName` is an event handler, its only parameter is the `event` object (although it isn't actually needed in this example, but it is useful to identify the function as an event handler). In this case, the purpose of the function is to call the `Update` function that changes the 'name' property to "Nanny State" by passing the object `{name: "Nanny State"}` as an argument to the `Update` function. Note that you ony have to include any properties of the State that need updating in this object(**Nanny State** assumes that all the other properties will stay the same). **NANNY STATE** will then automatically re-render the view using Âµhtml, which only updates the parts of the view that have actually changed. This means that re-rendering after a state update is fast and efficient.

We now have everything wired up correctly. When the user clicks the button, the `_changeName` event handler is called. This calls the `Update` function which changes the 'name' property to 'Nanny State' and re-renders the page based on this new state.

You can this code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/daz4126/pen/gOoBrJB). Try clicking the button to see the view change!

<div align="center">
  
![Click and change](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16646/168495502-3be53eae-ff34-4abd-ae32-bd500c9eb07d.gif)

</div>
  
Now let's try adding an event handler that uses some information passed to it in the `event` object. We'll create an input field that allows the user to update the `name` property as they type. Change the view to the following:
  
```javascript
const View = state => html`<h1>Hello ${state.name}</h1>
<input oninput=${state._changeName}>`
```
  
We've replaced the button element with an input field that uses the inline event listener `oninput` to call the `_changeName` event handler. We need to update this function inside the `State` object:
  
```javascript
 const State = {
  name: "World",
  _changeName: event => Update({name: event.target.value}),
  View
} 
```
  
This time the `Update` function is passed an object that replaces the `name` property of the state with the value of `event.target.value` which corresponds to the text entered into the input field. Every time the input changes, this event will fire and the view will be re-rendered to correspond to what has been typed into the input field.

You can this code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/daz4126/pen/qBpJNOp). Try typing into the input field and see the view change as you type!

<div align="center">

</div>
  
### Hello World, Goodbye World
  
This next example shows how to implement a toggle function as well as how to render parts of the view based on the value of properties in the State.

Start, in the usual way, by importing the relevant functions:

```javascript
import { Nanny, html } from 'nanny-state'
```
  
Next we'll create the view:

```javascript
const View = state => html`<h1>${state.salutation} World</h1>
  <button onclick=${state._changeSalutation}>${state.salutation === "Hello" ? "Goodbye" : "Hello"}</button>`
```
  
This view displays a property of the State called `salutation` followed by the string "World" inside `<h1>` tags. The value of `State.salutation` will either be "Hello" or "Goodbye". After this is a button element with an `onclick` event handler attached to it that calles the `_changeSalutation` State method. Inside the button we use a ternary operator to display "Goodbye" if the salutation is currenlty "Hello" or display "Hello" otherwise. We want the value of `State.salutation` to toggle between "Hello" and "Goodbye" when this button is clicked. 
  
Let's create the initial State and implement the `_changeSalutation` method:
  
```javascript
const State = {
  salutation: "Hello",
  _changeSalutation: event => 
    Update(state => ({salutation: state.salutation === "Hello" ? "Goodbye" : "Hello"})),
  View
}
```
  
As you can see, the `salutation` property is set to "Hello" initially and the `View` function is added to the `State` as usual. Let's take a closer look at the `_changeSalutation` method. In the previous examples, the `Update` function was passed a new representation of the state, but in this example it is passed a *transformer function*. These are particularly useful when the new state is based on the previous state, as in this case.
  
### Transformer Functions

A transformer function accepts the current state as an argument and returns a new representation of the state. They are basically a mapping function from the current state to a new state as shown in the diagram below:

<div align="center">

![Transformer function diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16646/171219151-031dd881-45dd-42e9-9f74-942fb75db2a4.png)

</div>
  
ES6 arrow functions are perfect for transformer functions as they visually show the mapping of the current state to a new representation of the state.

Transformer functions must be **[pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function)**. They should always return the same value given the same arguments and should not cause any side-effects. They take the following structure:

```javascript
state => newState
```

In the `_changeSalutation` example above,the transformer functions checks the value of the `state.salutation` property and then toggles the value accordingly, so if the value is "Hello" it updates it to "Goodbye" and vice-versa:
  
```javascript
state => ({salutation: state.salutation === "Hello" ? "Goodbye" : "Hello"})
```
  
Transformer functions are passed *by reference* to the `Update` function. The current state is implicityly passed as an argument to any transformer function (similiar to the way the event object is implicitly passed to event handlers when they are called).

All we we need to do now is start everything running and define the `Update` function:
  
```javascript
Nanny(State)
```

You can this code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/daz4126/pen/vYpVKJv). Click on the button to toggle the heading and button content!

<div align="center">
  
![Toggle content](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16646/171235861-6ee53a08-fb95-49c1-80b1-b3439eba1f5c.gif)

</div>

### Counter Example

**Nanny State** wouldn't be a state managememnt library without a counter example!

We start in the usual way by importing the necessary functions:

```javascript
import { Nanny, html } from 'nanny-state';
```

Now let's create the view that will return the HTML we want to display:

```javascript
const View = state => html`<button onclick=${state._incrementCount}>${state.count}</button>`
```

This is a button that displays the number of times the button has been clicked on, which is a property of the State called `count`. It also has an `onclick` event listener attached that is a method of the State called `_incrementCount`. This will be responsible for increasing the value of the `count` property by 1 every time the button is pressed.

Now we need to define the `State` object:

```javascript
const State = {
  count: 0,
  _incrementCount: event => Update(state => ({count: state.count + 1})),
  View
}
```
  
This sets the initial value of the `count` property to `0` and defines the `_incrementCount` method. It calls the `Update` function and passes a transformer function that sets the new value of `count` to the current value of `state.count` with `1` added on. 
  
Transformer functions don't need to return an object that represents every property of the new state. They only need to return an object that contains the properties that have actually changed. For example, if the initial state is represented by the following object:

```javascript
const State = {
  name: "World",
  count: 10
}
```

If we write a transformer function that doubles the count, then we only need to return an object that shows the new value of the 'count' property and don't need to worry about the 'name' property:

```javascript
state => ({ count: state.count * 2})
```

_Note: when arrow functions return an object literal, it needs wrapping in parentheses_

The state object in the parameter can also be destructured so that it only references properties required by the transformer function:

```javascript
{ count } => ({ count: count * 2})
``` 
  
As usual, the `State` object also requires `View` to be added as well.

Last of all, we just need to call the `Nanny` function and assign its return value to the variable `Update`:

```javascript
const Update = Nanny(State)
```

This will render the initial view with the count set to `0` and allow you to increase the count by clicking on the button.
  
You can this code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/daz4126/pen/gOoByma). Click on the button to increase the count!

<div align="center">
  
![Counter example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16646/171259876-ef897b54-a78a-4091-a600-e61b5f88c38e.gif)

</div>

### Adding Additional Arguments to Event Handlers

If you want an event handler to have parameters in addition to the event, then this can be done using a 'double-arrow' function and partial application. The additional arguments always come first and the event should be the last parameter provided to the function:

```javascript
const handler = params = event => newState
```
  
_Note that this is a standard Vanilla JS technique and not unique to Nanny State_

For example, if we wanted our counter app to have buttons that increased the count by 1, 2 or even decreased it by 1, then instead of writing a separate event handler for each button, we could write a function that accepted an extra parameter of how much to increase the value of `state.count` by. We could rewerite `_incrementCount` like so:

```javascript
_incrementCount: (n=1) => event => 
    Update(state => ({count: state.count + n}))
```

Here the parameter `n` is used to determine how much `state.count` is increased by and has a default value of `1`. This makes the event handler much more flexible.

When calling an event handler with parameters in the View, it needs to be partially applied with any arguments that are required. For example, this is how the View would now look with our extra buttons:

```javascript
const View = state => html`
<h1>${state.count}</h1>
<div>
  <button onclick=${state._incrementCount()}>+1</button>
  <button onclick=${state._incrementCount(2)}>+2</button>
  <button onclick=${state._incrementCount(-1)}>-1</button>
</div>`
```
  
Notice that the `state._incrementCount` function is actually *called* in the view with the first parameter provided (or if no parameter is provided the default value of `1` will be used. The `event` object will still be implicityly passed to the event handler (even though it isn't used in this example).
  
You can see the code for this updated counter example on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/daz4126/pen/NWXOmpd). Click on the buttons to increase or decrease the count by different amounts!

<div align="center">
  
![Counter example with partial application](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16646/171265054-dd46ddcf-aeea-4fac-8467-be0b7c2b3886.gif)

</div>
  
  
### Anonymous Event Handlers In The View
  
Because **NANNY STATE** just uses vanilla JS, you can define anonymous event handlers directly inside the `View`. For example, the counter example above could have been written with the following view instead:
  
```javascript
  const View = state => html`
  <button onclick=${e => Update(state => ({count: state.count + 1}))}>
    I've been pressed ${state.count} time${state.count === 1 ? "" : "s"}
  </button>`
```
This uses the following anonymous event handler:
  
```javascript
  e => Update(state => ({count: state.count + 1}))
```
  
This saves the event handler having to be defined in the `State` object, which can be useful for small updates such as this, although it could get unweildy for more complicated updates.

One advantage of using anonymous event handlers directly in the view is that they can access the state because the `View` function accepts the current state as an argument, whereas event handlers that are defined in the `State` object do not have access to the state.

## Extra Info

Now that you've learnt the basics of NANNY STATE, here's some extra info that helps give you some extra control over the settings.

### Before and After Functions

`Before` and `After` are properties of the state object and are functions that are called before or after a state update respectively. They can also be passed to the `Nanny` function as part of the `options` object.

For example, try updating the last line of the 'Hello Batman' example to the following code instead:

```javascript
State.Before = state => console.log('Before:', state)
State.After = state => console.log('After:', state)

const Update = Nanny(State)
```

Now, when you press the `I'm Batman` button, the following is logged to the console, showing how the state has changed:

```
"Before:"
{
  "name": "Bruce Wayne"
}
"After:"
{
  "name": "Batman"
}
```

### Default Element

By Default the view will be rendered inside the `body` element of the page. This can be changed using the `Element` property of the state object or by providing it as part of the `options` object of the `Nanny` function. For example, if you wanted the view to be rendered inside an element with the id of 'app', you just need to specify this as an option when you call the `Nanny` function:

```javascript
State.Element = document.getElementById('app')
```

### Debug Mode

`Debug` is a property of the state that is `false` by default, but if you set it to `true`, then the value of the state will be logged to the console after the initial render and after any state update"

```javascript
State.Debug = true
```
  
### Local Storage

`LocalStorageKey` is a property of the state that ensures that the state is automatically persisted using the browser's [local storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). It will also retrieve the state from the user's local storage every time they visit the site, ensuring persitance of the state between sessions. To use it, simply set this property to the string value that you want to be used as the local storage key. For example, the following setting will use the string "nanny" as the local storage key and ensure that the state is saved to local storage after every update:
  
  ```javascript
  State.LocalStorageKey = 'nanny'
  ```
  
### Routing
  
Routing is baked in to **NANNY STATE**. Remember that the State Is Everything, so it just gets set up in the `State` object. Simply define a property called `Routes` as an array of **route objects**. Route objects contain the following properties:
  
  * `path`: the path used to access the route
  * `title`: the title property of the route
  * `view`: a function that works exactly like the main `View` function (a bit like a sub-view) and accepts the current state as an argument and returns a string of HTML
  
Here's a basic example:
  
```javascript
Routes: [
    { path: '/', title: 'Home', view: state => html`<h1>Home</h1>` },
    { path: 'about', title: 'About', view: state => html`<h1>About Us</h1>` },
    { path: 'contact', title: 'Contact', view: state => html`<h1>Contact Us</h1>` }
  ]
```
  
Let's use those route objects to build a mini single-page website.
  
First of all we need to create the main `View`. When using routes, this takes the form of a template layout for *all* pages and we use the special `Content` property of the State to indicate where the specific content from each route will be displayed in the layout. Here's a basic example:
  
```javascript
const View = state => html` <h1>Nanny State</h1>
  <h2>Router</h2>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/" onclick=${state.Route()}>Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about" onclick=${state.Route()}>About</a></li>
      <li><a href="/contact" onclick=${state.Route()}>Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
  <main>${state.Content}</main>`
```
The first thing to notice here are the `state.Content` property inside the `<main>` tags. This will render a different view, depending on the route. This is the function that is provided as the `view` property in the route object.

The other thing to notice is the built-in `state.Route()` method. This will update the current route to the argument provided. If no argument is provided then it will automatically use the value of the `href` attribute. So, in the example above, clicking on the 'About' link will update the route to '/about'.
  
Now we just need to create the initial `State` object. This needs to contain the `Routes` array that contains a route object for each route as well as the `View`:
  
```javascript
const State = {
   Routes: [
    { path: '/', title: 'Home', view: state => html`<h1>Home</h1>` },
    { path: 'about', title: 'About', view: state => html`<h1>About Us</h1>` },
    { path: 'contact', title: 'Contact', view: state => html`<h1>Contact Us</h1>` }
  ],
  View
}  
```

Last of all we just need to start the Nanny State:
  
```javascript
Nanny(State)
```

_Note that in the is example we didn't need the `Update` function_

You can see this example on [CodeSandbox](https://si96c4.csb.app) (_note that routing won't work on CodePen_).
